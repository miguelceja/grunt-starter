# Grunt Starter Kit

Grunt starter kit to get up and running quickly with a static site.  `Grunt.js` comes configured with Sass and Babel.

Write your JS in `js/app.js`.  And all your Sass can go in `css/scss/` files.

This uses PHP files to make templating easier, but you can convert the index.php to .html if you just need something simple.

## Instructions

Clone this repo to your local dev environment.

Change directories to the `grunt-starter` folder, then run `npm install`.

Then just run `grunt watch` and start coding.
